# CSCA5632 - Unsupervised Learning

Materials for the CSCA5632 course focused on unsupervised learning. The project explores various unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** To implement and evaluate unsupervised learning algorithms.
- **Techniques:** Clustering (e.g., K-means, Hierarchical Clustering), Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE), and other methods.
- **Dataset:** The repository uses curated datasets for hands-on experiments and evaluations.
